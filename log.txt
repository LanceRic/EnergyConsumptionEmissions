Inside PowerShell perform following commands:

echo "# EnergyConsumptionEmissions" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/LanceRic/EnergyConsumptionEmissions.git
git push -u origin master


I then dragged my shiny app folder into the EnergyConsumptionEmissions directory in my desktop folder and ran the following command
git add .\ExplorePowerPlants\


I then created the current log.tx file that I am currently typing in and ran the following command
git add .\log.txt


Then I committed the above changes and pushed the additions to the repo
git commit
git push
